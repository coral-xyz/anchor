# Binary Size

All notable changes in program binary size will be documented in this file.

The changes are calculated by comparing the current results with the last version's results. Increase in size is shown with ðŸ”´ and decrease is shown with ðŸŸ¢.

The programs and their tests are located in [/tests/bench](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor/tree/master/tests/bench).

> **Note**
> Results documented in this file are autogenerated. Running the tests will update the current results when necessary, manually editing the results should be avoided.

> **Warning**
> Results may vary depending on Solana version.
