//! Defines the instructions and account state used to store a program's
//! IDL on-chain at a canonical account address, which can be derived as a
//! function of nothing other than the program's ID.
//!
//! It can be upgraded in a way similar to a BPF upgradeable program. That is,
//! one may invoke the `IdlInstruction::CreateBuffer` instruction to create
//! a buffer, `IdlInstruction::Write` to write a new IDL into it, and then
//! `IdlInstruction::SetBuffer` to copy the IDL into the program's canonical
//! IDL account. In order to perform this upgrade, the buffer's `authority`
//! must match the canonical IDL account's authority.
//!
//! Because the IDL can be larger than the max transaction size, the transaction
//! must be broken up into several pieces and stored into the IDL account with
//! multiple transactions via the `Write` instruction to continuously append to
//! the account's IDL data buffer.
//!
//! Note that IDL account instructions are automatically inserted into all
//! Anchor programs. To remove them, one can use the `no-idl` feature.
