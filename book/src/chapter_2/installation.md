### Install using pre-build binary on x86_64 Linux

Anchor binaries are available via an NPM package [`@project-serum/anchor-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@project-serum/anchor-cli). Only `x86_64` Linux is supported currently, you must build from source for other OS'.

### Build from source for other operating systems

For now, we can use Cargo to install the CLI.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --tag v0.20.1 anchor-cli --locked
```

On Linux systems you may need to install additional dependencies if cargo install fails. On Ubuntu,

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev
```

Now verify the CLI is installed properly.

```
anchor --version
```

### Installing using Anchor version manager (avm)

It is recommended you uninstall the NPM package if you have it installed.

Install `avm` using Cargo. Note this will replace your `anchor` binary if you had one installed.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor --locked --force
```

Install the latest version of the CLI using `avm`.

```
avm use latest
```

Verify the installation.

```
anchor --version
```
