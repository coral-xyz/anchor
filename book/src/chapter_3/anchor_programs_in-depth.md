# Anchor Programs In-Depth
This section explains how you can use Anchor to build Solana programs. Each section includes code examples, so it is recommended that you start up a new Anchor project before you proceed so you can play around with the code yourself while reading. Call it `hello-anchor`.
```
anchor init hello-anchor
```

This sections begins with the essentials and then explains more intermediate content afterwards.
