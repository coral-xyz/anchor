## [Unreleased]

### Features

* lang: Add `#[account(address = <expr>)]` constraint for asserting the address of an account ([#400](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/400)).
* lang: Add `#[account(init, token = <mint-target>, authority = <token-owner-target>...)]` constraint for initializing SPL token accounts as program derived addresses for the program. Can be used when initialized via `seeds` or `associated` ([#400](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/400)).
* lang: Add `associated_seeds!` macro for generating signer seeds for CPIs signed by an `#[account(associated = <target>)]` account ([#400](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/400)).
* cli: Add `[scripts]` section to the Anchor.toml for specifying workspace scripts that can be run via `anchor run <script>` ([#400](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/400)).
* cli: `[clusters.<network>]` table entries can now also use `{ address = <base58-str>, idl = <filepath-str> }` to specify workspace programs ([#400](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/400)).

### Features

* cli: Add `--program-name` option for build command to build a single program at a time ([#362](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/362)).

* lang: `#[account(associated)]` now requires `init` to be provided to create an associated account. If not provided, then the address will be assumed to exist, and a constraint will be added to ensure the correctness of the address ([#318](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/318)).
* lang, ts: Change account discriminator pre-image of the `#[state]` account discriminator to be namespaced by "state:" ([#320](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/320)).
