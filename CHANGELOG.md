* lang: `UncheckedAccount` type introduced as a preferred alias for `AccountInfo` ([#745](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/745)).

### Breaking Changes

* lang: `#[account(owner = <pubkey>)]` now requires a `Pubkey` instead of an account ([#691](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/691)).

## [0.15.0] - 2021-09-07

### Features

* lang: Add new `Account` type to replace `ProgramAccount` and `CpiAccount`, both of which are deprecated ([#686](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/686)).
* lang: `Box` can be used with `Account` types to reduce stack usage ([#686](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/686)).

### Features

* lang: Ignore `Unnamed` structs instead of panic ([#605](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/605)).
* lang: Add constraints for initializing mint accounts as pdas, `#[account(init, seeds = [...], mint::decimals = <expr>, mint::authority = <expr>)]` ([#562](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/562)).

* lang: Change `#[account(init, seeds = [...], token = <expr>, authority = <expr>)]` to `#[account(init, token::mint = <expr> token::authority = <expr>)]` ([#562](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/562)).
* lang: `#[associated]` and `#[account(associated = <target>, with = <target>)]` are both removed ([#612](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/612)).
* cli: Removed `anchor launch` command ([#634](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/634)).
* lang: `#[account(init)]` now creates the account inside the same instruction to be consistent with initializing PDAs. To maintain the old behavior of `init`, replace it with `#[account(zero)]` ([#641](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/641)).
* lang: `bump` must be provided when using the `seeds` constraint. This has been added as an extra safety constraint to ensure that whenever a PDA is initialized via a constraint the bump used is the one created by `Pubkey::find_program_address` ([#641](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/641)).
* lang: `try_from_init` has been removed from `Loader`, `ProgramAccount`, and `CpiAccount`  and replaced with `try_from_unchecked` ([#641](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/641)).

* lang: A new `bump` keyword is added to the accounts constraints, which is used to add an optional bump seed to the end of a `seeds` array. When used in conjunction with *both* `init` and `seeds`, then the program executes `find_program_address` to assert that the given bump is the canonical bump ([#483](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/pull/483)).

### Fixes
