Anchor is a framework for Solana's [Sealevel](https://medium.com/solana-labs/sealevel-parallel-processing-thousands-of-smart-contracts-d814b378192) runtime providing several convenient developer tools for writing smart contracts.

- Rust eDSL for writing Solana programs
- [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) specification
- TypeScript package for generating clients from IDL
- CLI and workspace management for developing complete applications

If you're familiar with developing in Ethereum's [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.4/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js), then the experience will be familiar. Although the DSL syntax and semantics are targeted at Solana, the high level flow of writing RPC request handlers, emitting an IDL, and generating clients from IDL is the same.

## Getting Started

For a quickstart guide and in depth tutorials, see the guided [documentation](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/introduction.html).
To jump straight to examples, go [here](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor/tree/master/examples). For the latest Rust and TypeScript API documentation, see [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang) and the [typedoc](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/ts/index.html).

## Examples

Here's a counter program, where only the designated `authority`
can increment the count.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
mod counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>, start: u64) -> ProgramResult {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.authority = *ctx.accounts.authority.key;
        counter.count = start;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Increment>) -> ProgramResult {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count += 1;
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 48)]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Increment<'info> {
    #[account(mut, has_one = authority)]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    pub authority: Signer<'info>,
}

#[account]
pub struct Counter {
    pub authority: Pubkey,
    pub count: u64,
}
```
