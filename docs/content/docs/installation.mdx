This section covers the steps to set up your local environment for Solana
development.

## Install Dependencies

- Windows users must first install WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) and then
  install the dependencies specified in the Linux section below.
- Linux users should first install the dependencies specified in the Linux
  section below.
- Mac users should start with the Rust installation instructions below.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)">
    To develop Solana programs on Windows **you must use
    [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)** (Windows
    subsystem for Linux). All additional dependencies must be installed through the
    Linux terminal.

    Once WSL is installed, install the dependencies specified in the Linux section
    below before proceeding to install Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI.

    To install WSL, run the following command in Windows PowerShell:

    ```shell
    wsl --install
    ```

    The install process will prompt you to create a default user account.

    ![WSL Install](/docs/installation/wsl-install.png)

    By default, WSL installs Ubuntu. You can open a Linux terminal by searching
    "Ubuntu" in the Search bar.

    ![WSL Ubuntu](/docs/installation/wsl-ubuntu-search.png)

    If your Ubuntu terminal looks like the image below, you may encounter an issue
    where `ctrl + v` (paste keyboard shortcut) doesn't work in the terminal.

    ![Ubuntu Terminal](/docs/installation/wsl-ubuntu-terminal-1.png)

    If you encounter this issue, open Windows Terminal by searching for "Terminal"
    in the Search bar.

    ![Windows Terminal](/docs/installation/wsl-windows-terminal.png)

    Next, close the Windows Terminal and reopen a Linux terminal by searching for
    Ubuntu again. The terminal should now look like the image below, where
    `ctrl + v` (paste keyboard shortcut) works.

    ![Ubuntu Terminal](/docs/installation/wsl-ubuntu-terminal-2.png)

    If you are using VS Code, the
    [WSL extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial) enables
    you to use WSL and VS Code together.

    ![WSL Setup in VS Code](/docs/installation/wsl-vscode.png)

    You should then see the following in the VS Code status bar:

    ![WSL: Ubuntu](/docs/installation/wsl-vscode-ubuntu.png)

    Once you have WSL set up, all additional dependencies must be installed through
    the Linux terminal. Install the dependencies specified in the Linux section
    below before proceeding to install Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Linux">
    The following dependencies are required for the Anchor CLI installation.

    First, run the following command:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

    Next, install the following dependencies:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install -y \
        build-essential \
        pkg-config \
        libudev-dev llvm libclang-dev \
        protobuf-compiler libssl-dev
    ```

    If you encounter the following error when installing `protobuf-compiler`, make
    sure you first run `sudo apt-get update`:

    ```
    Package protobuf-compiler is not available, but is referred to by another package.
    This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
    is only available from another source
    ```

  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

<Steps>
<Step>

### Install Rust

Solana programs are written in the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The recommended installation method for Rust is
[rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Run the following command to install Rust:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

You should see the following message after the installation completes:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Successful Rust Install Message">

```
Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).

To configure your current shell, you need to source
the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.

This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"            # For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

Run the following command to reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory:

```shell
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

To verify that the installation was successful, check the Rust version:

```shell
rustc --version
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
rustc 1.80.1 (3f5fd8dd4 2024-08-06)
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Install the Solana CLI

The Solana CLI provides all the tools required to build and deploy Solana
programs.

Install the Solana CLI tool suite using the official install command:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
```

You can replace `stable` with the release tag matching the software version of
your desired release (i.e. `v2.0.3`), or use one of the three symbolic channel
names: `stable`, `beta`, or `edge`.

If it is your first time installing the Solana CLI, you may see the following
message prompting you to add a PATH environment variable:

```
Close and reopen your terminal to apply the PATH changes or run the following in your existing shell:

export PATH="/Users/test/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

<Tabs groupId="language" items={['Linux', 'Mac']}>
<Tab value="Linux">

If you are using a Linux or WSL terminal, you can add the PATH environment
variable to your shell configuration file by running the command logged from the
installation or by restarting your terminal.

```shell
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Mac">

If you're on Mac using `zsh`, running the default `export PATH` command logged
from the installation does not persist once you close your terminal.

Instead, you can add the PATH to your shell configuration file by running the
following command:

```shell
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then run the following command to refresh the terminal session or restart your
terminal.

```shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

To verify that the installation was successful, check the Solana CLI version:

```shell
solana --version
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
solana-cli 1.18.22 (src:9efdd74b; feat:4215500110, client:Agave)
```

You can view all available versions on the
[Agave Github repo](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/releases).

<Callout>

Agave is the validator client from [Anza](https://www.anza.xyz/), formerly known
as Solana Labs validator client.

</Callout>

To later update the Solana CLI to the latest version, you can use the following
command:

```shell
agave-install update
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Install Anchor CLI

Anchor is a framework for developing Solana
programs. The Anchor framework leverages Rust macros to simplify the process of
writing Solana programs.

There are two ways to install the Anchor CLI and tooling:

1. Using Anchor Version Manager (AVM) - is the **recommended installation**
   method since it simplifies updating Anchor versions in the future
2. Without AVM - this requires more a manual process to update Anchor versions
   later

<Tabs groupId="anchor" items={['AVM', 'Without AVM']}>
<Tab value="AVM">

The Anchor version manager (AVM) allows you to install and manage different
Anchor versions on your system, including more easily updating Anchor versions
in the future.

Install AVM with the following command:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
```

Test to ensure AVM was installed and is accessible:

```shell
avm --version
```

Install the latest version of Anchor CLI using AVM:

```shell
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

Or install a specific version of the Anchor CLI by declaring which version you
want to install:

```shell
avm install 0.30.1
avm use 0.30.1
```

> Don't forget to run the `avm use` command to declare which Anchor CLI version
> should be used on your system.
>
> - If you installed the `latest` version, run `avm use latest`.
> - If you installed the version `0.30.1`, run `avm use 0.30.1`.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Without AVM">

Install a specific version of the Anchor CLI with the following command:

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor --tag v0.30.1 anchor-cli
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

You may see the following warning during installation. However, it does not
affect the installation process.

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

To verify that the installation was successful, check the Anchor CLI version:

```shell
anchor --version
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
anchor-cli 0.30.1
```

When installing the Anchor CLI on Linux or WSL, you may encounter this error:

```
error: could not exec the linker cc = note: Permission denied (os error 13)
```

If you see this error message, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies listed in the Linux section at the top of this page.
2. Retry installing the Anchor CLI.

#### Node.js and Yarn

Node.js and Yarn are required to run the default Anchor project test file
(TypeScript) created with the `anchor init` command. (Rust test template is also
available using `anchor init --test-template rust`)

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Node Installation">

The recommended way to install node is using
[Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Install nvm using the following command:

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
```

Restart your terminal and verify that nvm is installed:

```shell
command -v nvm
```

Next, use `nvm` to install node:

```shell
nvm install node
```

To verify that the installation was successful, check the Node version:

```
node --version
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
v22.7.0
```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Yarn Installation">

Install Yarn:

```shell
npm install --global yarn
```

To verify that the installation was successful, check the Yarn version:

```
yarn --version
```

You should the following output:

```
1.22.1
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

When running `anchor build`, if you encounter `error: not a directory` similar
following:

```
error: not a directory: '.../solana-release/bin/sdk/sbf/dependencies/platform-tools/rust/lib'
```

Try these solutions:

1. Force install using the following command:

```shell
cargo build-sbf --force-tools-install
```

2. If the above doesn't work, clear the Solana cache:

```shell
rm -rf ~/.cache/solana/*
```

After applying either solution, attempt to run `anchor build` again.

If you are on Linux or WSL and encounter the following errors when running
`anchor test` after creating a new Anchor project, it's may be due to missing
Node.js or Yarn:

```
Permission denied (os error 13)
```

```
No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Solana CLI Basics

This section will walk through some common Solana CLI commands to get you
started.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Solana Config

To see your current config:

```shell
solana config get
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Config File: /Users/test/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
RPC URL: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
WebSocket URL: wss://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/ (computed)
Keypair Path: /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
Commitment: confirmed
```

The RPC URL and Websocket URL specific the Solana cluster the CLI will make
requests to. By default this will be mainnet-beta.

You can update the Solana CLI cluster using the following commands:

```
solana config set --url mainnet-beta
solana config set --url devnet
solana config set --url localhost
solana config set --url testnet
```

You can also use the following short options:

```
solana config set -um    # For mainnet-beta
solana config set -ud    # For devnet
solana config set -ul    # For localhost
solana config set -ut    # For testnet
```

The Keypair Path specifies the location of the default wallet used by the Solana
CLI (to pay transaction fees and deploy programs). The default path is
`~/.config/solana/id.json`. The next step walks through how to generate a
keypair at the default location.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Wallet

To interact with the Solana network using the Solana CLI, you need a Solana
wallet funded with SOL.

To generate a keypair at the default Keypair Path, run the following command:

```shell
solana-keygen new
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Generating a new keypair

For added security, enter a BIP39 passphrase

NOTE! This passphrase improves security of the recovery seed phrae NOT the
keypair file itself, which is stored as insecure plain text

BIP39 Passphrase (empty for none):

Wrote new keypair to /Users/test/.config/solana/id.json
===========================================================================
pubkey: 8dBTPrjnkXyuQK3KDt9wrZBfizEZijmmUQXVHpFbVwGT
===========================================================================
Save this seed phrase and your BIP39 passphrase to recover your new keypair:
cream bleak tortoise ocean nasty game gift forget fancy salon mimic amazing
===========================================================================
```

<Callout type="note">

If you already have a file system wallet saved at the default location, this
command will **NOT** override it unless you explicitly force override using the
`--force` flag.

</Callout>

Once a keypair is generated, you can get the address (public key) of the keypair
with the following command:

```shell
solana address
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Airdrop SOL

Once you've set up your local wallet, request an airdrop of SOL to fund your
wallet. You need SOL to pay for transaction fees and to deploy programs.

Set your cluster to the devnet:

```shell
solana config set -ud
```

Then request an airdrop of devnet SOL:

```shell
solana airdrop 2
```

To check your wallet's SOL balance, run the following command:

```shell
solana balance
```

<Callout>

The `solana airdrop` command is currently limited to 5 SOL per request on
devnet. Errors are likely due to rate limits.

Alternatively, you can get devnet SOL using the
[Solana Web Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com).

</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>

### Run Local Validator

The Solana CLI comes with the
[test validator](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/examples/test-validator)
built-in. Running a local validator will allow you to deploy and test your
programs locally.

In a separate terminal, run the following command to start a local validator:

```shell
solana-test-validator
```

Make sure to update the Solana CLI config to localhost before commands.

```shell
solana config set -ul
```

</Step>
</Steps>
