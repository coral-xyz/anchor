Anchor Version Manager (avm) is provided to manage multiple installations of the
anchor-cli binary. This may be required to produce verifiable builds, or if
you'd prefer to work with an alternate version.

```shell
Anchor version manager

USAGE:
    avm <SUBCOMMAND>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Print help information
    -V, --version    Print version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    install      Install a version of Anchor
    list         List available versions of Anchor
    uninstall    Uninstall a version of Anchor
    use          Use a specific version of Anchor
```

## Install

```shell
avm install <VERSION_OR_COMMIT>
```

Install the specified version of anchor-cli. The version argument should follow
semver versioning. It is also possible to use `latest` as the version argument
to install the latest version.

It's also possible to install based on a specific commit hash:

```shell
# <VERSION>-<COMMIT>
avm install 0.30.1-cfe82aa682138f7c6c58bf7a78f48f7d63e9e466

# Full commit hash
avm install cfe82aa682138f7c6c58bf7a78f48f7d63e9e466

# Short commit hash
avm install cfe82aa
```

## List

```shell
avm list
```

## Uninstall

```shell
avm uninstall <version>
```

## Use

```shell
avm use <version>
```

Use a specific version. This version will remain in use until you change it by
calling the same command again. Similarly to `avm install`, you can also use
`latest` for the version.
