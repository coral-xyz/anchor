  Learn how to build Solana programs using the Anchor framework on your local
  machine.
---

The Anchor framework is a tool that simplifies the process of building Solana
programs. Whether you're new to blockchain development or an experienced
programmer, Anchor simplifies the process of writing, testing, and deploying
Solana programs.

In this section, we'll walk through:

- Creating a new Anchor project
- Building and testing your program
- Deploying to Solana clusters
- Understanding the project file structure

## Prerequisites

For detailed installation instructions, visit the
[installation](/docs/installation) page.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust: The programming language for building Solana programs.
- Solana CLI: Command-line tool for Solana development.
- Anchor CLI: Command-line tool for the Anchor framework.

To verify Anchor CLI installation, open your terminal and run:

```shell filename="Terminal"
anchor --version
```

Expected output:

```shell filename="Terminal"
anchor-cli 0.30.1
```

## Getting Started

This section covers the basic steps to create, build, and test your first local
Anchor program.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a new Project

To start a new project, use the `anchor init` command followed by your project's
name. This command creates a new directory with the specified name and sets up a
default program and test file.

```shell filename="Terminal"
anchor init my-program
```

Navigate to the new project directory and open it in your code editor.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
cd my-project
```

The default Anchor program is located at `/programs/my-project/src/lib.rs`.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Default Program">

The value in the `declare_id!` macro is the program ID, a unique identifier for
your program.

By default, it is the public key of the keypair generated in
`/target/deploy/my_project-keypair.json`.

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("3ynNB373Q3VAzKp7m4x238po36hjAGFXFJB4ybN2iTyg");

#[program]
pub mod my_project {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        msg!("Greetings from: {:?}", ctx.program_id);
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

The default Typescript test file is located at `/tests/my-project.ts`.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Default Test File">

This file demonstrates how to invoke the default program's `initialize`
instruction in Typescript.

```ts filename="my-project.ts"
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { MyProject } from "../target/types/my_project";

describe("my-project", () => {
  // Configure the client to use the local cluster.
  anchor.setProvider(anchor.AnchorProvider.env());

  const program = anchor.workspace.MyProject as Program<MyProject>;

  it("Is initialized!", async () => {
    // Add your test here.
    const tx = await program.methods.initialize().rpc();
    console.log("Your transaction signature", tx);
  });
});
```

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

If you prefer Rust for testing, initialize your project with the
`--test-template rust` ([Anchor Rust client](/docs/clients/rust)) or
`--test-template mollusk` ([Mollusk test library](/docs/testing/mollusk)) flag.

```shell
anchor init --test-template rust my-program
```

The Rust test file will be at `/tests/src/test_initialize.rs`.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Rust Test File">

```rust filename="test_initialize.rs"
use std::str::FromStr;

use anchor_client::{
    solana_sdk::{
        commitment_config::CommitmentConfig, pubkey::Pubkey, signature::read_keypair_file,
    },
    Client, Cluster,
};

#[test]
fn test_initialize() {
    let program_id = "3ynNB373Q3VAzKp7m4x238po36hjAGFXFJB4ybN2iTyg";
    let anchor_wallet = std::env::var("ANCHOR_WALLET").unwrap();
    let payer = read_keypair_file(&anchor_wallet).unwrap();

    let client = Client::new_with_options(Cluster::Localnet, &payer, CommitmentConfig::confirmed());
    let program_id = Pubkey::from_str(program_id).unwrap();
    let program = client.program(program_id).unwrap();

    let tx = program
        .request()
        .accounts(my_program::accounts::Initialize {})
        .args(my_program::instruction::Initialize {})
        .send()
        .expect("");

    println!("Your transaction signature {}", tx);
}
```

</Accordions>

</Step>
<Step>

### Build the Program

Build the program by running `anchor build`.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor build
```

The compiled program will be at `/target/deploy/my_project.so`. The content of
this file is what gets stored on the Solana network (as an executable account)
when you deploy your program.

</Step>
<Step>

### Test the Program

To test the program, run `anchor test`.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor test
```

By default, the `Anchor.toml` config file specifies the `localnet` cluster. When
developing on `localnet`, `anchor test` will automatically:

1. Start a local Solana validator
2. Build and deploy your program to the local cluster
3. Run the tests in the `tests` folder
4. Stop the local Solana validator

Alternatively, you can manually start a local Solana validator and run tests
against it. This is useful if you want to keep the validator running while you
iterate on your program. It allows you to inspect accounts and transaction logs
on the [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=custom) while
developing locally.

Open a new terminal and start a local Solana validator by running the
`solana-test-validator` command.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
solana-test-validator
```

In a separate terminal, run the tests against the local cluster. Use the
`--skip-local-validator` flag to skip starting the local validator since it's
already running.

```shell filename="Terminal" copy
anchor test --skip-local-validator
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy to Devnet

By default, the `Anchor.toml` config file in an Anchor project specifies the
localnet cluster.

```toml filename="Anchor.toml" {14}
[toolchain]

[features]
resolution = true
skip-lint = false

[programs.localnet]
my_program = "3ynNB373Q3VAzKp7m4x238po36hjAGFXFJB4ybN2iTyg"

[registry]
url = "https://api.apr.dev"

[provider]
cluster = "Localnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"

[scripts]
test = "yarn run ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/**/*.ts"
```

To deploy your program to devnet, change the `cluster` value to `Devnet`.

<Callout type="info">

Note that deploying to devnet requires your wallet to have enough SOL to cover
deployment cost. You can get devnet SOL using the
[Web Faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

</Callout>

```diff
-cluster = "Localnet"
+cluster = "Devnet"
```

```toml filename="Anchor.toml"
[provider]
cluster = "Devnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
```

Now when you run `anchor deploy`, your program will be deployed to the devnet
cluster. The `anchor test` command will also use the cluster specified in the
`Anchor.toml` file.

```shell
anchor deploy
```

To deploy to mainnet, simply update the `Anchor.toml` file to specify the
mainnet cluster.

```toml filename="Anchor.toml"
[provider]
cluster = "Mainnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Update the Program

Solana programs can be updated by redeploying the program to the same program
ID.

To update a program, simply make changes to your program's code and run the
`anchor build` command to generated an updated `.so` file.

```shell
anchor build
```

Then run the `anchor deploy` command to redeploy the updated program.

```shell
anchor deploy
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Close the Program

To reclaim the SOL allocated to a program account, you can close your Solana
program.

To close a program, use the `solana program close <PROGRAM_ID>` command. For
example:

```shell
solana program close 3ynNB373Q3VAzKp7m4x238po36hjAGFXFJB4ybN2iTyg --bypass-warning
```

Note that once a program is closed, the program ID cannot be reused to deploy a
new program.

</Step>

## Project File Structure

Below is an overview of default file structure in an Anchor workspace:

<Files>
  <Folder name=".anchor">
    <File name="program-logs" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="app" />
  <Folder name="migrations" />
  <Folder name="programs" defaultOpen={true}>
    <Folder name="[project-name]" defaultOpen={true}>
      <Folder name="src" defaultOpen={true}>
        <File name="lib.rs" />
        <File name="Cargo.toml" />
        <File name="Xargo.toml" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="target" defaultOpen={true}>
    <Folder name="deploy">
      <File name="[project-name]-keypair.json" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="idl">

  <File name="package.json" />
</Files>

### Programs Folder

The `/programs` directory contains your project's Anchor programs. A single
workspace can contain multiple programs.

### Tests Folder

The `/tests` directory contains test files for your project. A default test file
is created for you when you create your project.

### Target Folder

The `/target` directory contains build outputs. The main subfolders include:

- `/deploy`: Contains the keypair and program binary for your programs.
- `/idl`: Contains the JSON IDL for your programs.
- `/types`: Contains the TypeScript type for the IDL.

### Anchor.toml File

The `Anchor.toml` file configures workspace settings for your project.

### .anchor Folder

Includes a `program-logs` file that contains transaction logs from the last run
of test files.

### App Folder

The `/app` folder is an empty folder that can be optionally used for your
frontend code.
