title: PDA Sharing Exploit
description: Anchor - In this Chapter of Common Security Exploits of Sealevel, or Sealevel Attacks, we do a deep dive on how malicious actors can use pda sharing to attack your program
---

## Overview
The PDA sharing exploit occurs whenever a program uses one PDA as an authority for multiple "sources".
Using a `TokenPool` as an example, it would be a problem to use one PDA that handles transfers for multiple pools.
See the example below.
### Insecure

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_insecure {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> ProgramResult {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[ctx.accounts.pool.mint.as_ref(), &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump]];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(has_one = vault, has_one = withdraw_destination)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```
This code is insecure because of the seeds we use to generate the PDA.
Since we use the `mint` Pubkey for a token account, this will mean that any pools generated with the same coin - say USDC â€” would share the same seed for their PDA.
This would mean if you had a pool of 1,000 USDC, an attacker could make a duplicate pool that also used USDC, and would have full access to drain your pool.
To fix this, we need to use a seed that can not be reproduced by multiple users.

### Secure

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_secure {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> ProgramResult {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[
            ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination.as_ref(),
            &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump],
        ];
        let (address, expected_bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(seeds, ctx.program_id);
        if address != ctx.accounts.pool.key() {
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
        }
        if expected_bump != ctx.accounts.pool.bump {
            return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
        }
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(has_one = vault, has_one = withdraw_destination)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```
Instead of using the `mint` Pubkey we use the `withdraw_destination` since that is a token account unique to the user withdrawing.
There is another step we can take to further secure the program.
We need to check that our bump matches our expected bump, and that the resulting address matches our `pool` address.


Anchor gives us a way to do this in the accounts instead of the program; take a look at the example below.

### Recommended
```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_recommended {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> ProgramResult {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[
            ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination.as_ref(),
            &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump],
        ];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(
				has_one = vault,
				has_one = withdraw_destination,
				seeds = [withdraw_destination.key().as_ref()],
				bump = pool.bump,
		)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```

Here you can see that we have added more constraints to our `TokenPool` account.
This will ensure that the bump and seed(s) we use in the `TokenPool` are always linked to our `pool.bump` and the `withdraw_destination`.
