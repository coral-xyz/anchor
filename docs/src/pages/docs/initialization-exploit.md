title: Initialization exploit
description: In this page we go through several examples on how you can exploit a program through an Initialization vulnerability. The Reader is then shown how to patch the insecure code in Anchor idiomatic ways.
---

## Overview
The initialization vulnerability is when your program does not properly identify the account you are initializing.
It is similar to the type-cosplay exploit, as it has to do with checking the discriminators.
See the example below.
### Insecure

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use borsh::{BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize};
use std::ops::DerefMut;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod initialization_insecure {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> ProgramResult {
        let mut user = User::try_from_slice(&ctx.accounts.user.data.borrow()).unwrap();

        user.authority = ctx.accounts.authority.key();

        let mut storage = ctx.accounts.user.try_borrow_mut_data()?;
        user.serialize(storage.deref_mut()).unwrap();
        Ok(())
    }
}

/*
- reinitialize
- create and dont initialize
- passing previously initialzed accounts from other programs
  (e.g. token program => need to check delegate and authority)
*/

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    user: AccountInfo<'info>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
}

#[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize)]
pub struct User {
    authority: Pubkey,
}
```
This code is insecure because the `User` account could be a different account type since there is no discriminator.
Another side effect of this, is that you could call initialize on an already-existing account.

### Secure
```rust
// TODO
```
### Recommended
```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod initialization_recommended {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize_preferred(ctx: Context<Init>) -> ProgramResult {
        msg!("GM");
        Ok(())
    }
}


#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Init<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = authority, space = 8+32)]
    user: Account<'info, User>,
    authority: Signer<'info>,
    system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
pub struct User {
    authority: Pubkey,
}
```
This is the ideal way to write your program when you need to initialize an account.
Here we use `#[account(init ...)]` to create a new account, and set its discriminator.
Using `init` will create the account via a CPI to the system program and initialize it.
This will ensure that you aren't ever re-initializing an account, and that it always belongs to the correct program.


Again, you may see a recurring theme here.
Anchor tries to do as much of the validation for you with the Account structs to ensure that your programs won't execute on arbitrarily declared data/accounts.
