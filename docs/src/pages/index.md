## What is Anchor

Anchor is a framework for quickly building secure Solana programs.

With Anchor you can build programs quickly because it writes various boilerplate for you such as (de)serialization of accounts and instruction data.

You can build secure programs more easily because Anchor handles certain security checks for you. On top of that, it allows you to succinctly define additional checks and keep them separate from your business logic.

Both of these aspects mean that instead of working on the tedious parts of raw Solana programs, you can spend more time working on what matters most, your product.

### Documentation

Anchor's official documentation is split up into multiple parts, namely the guide, which is what you are reading right now and the references.

There are three references. One for the [core library](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/) and one for each official client library ([typescript](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/ts/index.html) and [rust](https://docs.rs/anchor-client/latest/anchor_client/)). These references are close to the code and detailed. If you know what you are looking for and want to understand how it works more deeply, you'll find explanations there.

However, if you're new to anchor, you need to know what anchor has to offer before you can even try to understand it more deeply. That's what this guide is for. Its purpose is to introduce you to anchor, to help you become familiar with it. It teaches you what features are available in Anchor so you can explore them yourself in detail using the references.
