# Tests

No program here is guaranteed to be safe or secure in any way. In most cases, they are
simply just simple integration tests to illustrate some particular functionality
of the framework. If used, one should audit any programs used and take full
responsibility for the consequences that occur due to any outstanding bugs
or security vulnerabilities that exist.
