//! idl.rs defines the instructions and account state used to store a
//! program's IDL.
//!
//! Note that the transaction to store the IDL can be larger than the max
//! transaction size. As a reuslt, the transaction must be broken up into
//! several pieces and stored into the IDL account with multiple transactions
//! via the `Write` instruction to continuously append to the account's IDL data
//! buffer.
//!
//! To upgrade the IDL, first invoke the `Clear` instruction to reset the data.
//! And invoke `Write` once more. To eliminate the ability to change the IDL,
//! set the authority to a key for which you can't sign, e.g., the zero address
//! or the system program ID, or compile the program with the "no-idl" feature
//! and upgrade the program with the upgradeable BPF loader.
